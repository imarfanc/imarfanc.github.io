## 3. DON'T CRITICIZE

{: .box-error}
Stop criticizing her, rather correct in love. Most will say it's constructive criticism. But truly, It means disapproval by pointing out errors and mistakes.
Correction is the act of offering better options to mistakes.
Correction and criticism are never the same.

### Example:

**Husband A (Criticism):**
"What manner of food is this? Is this popcorn or fried rice? How I wish I married a more sensible wife with better home training, who can cook better."

**Husband B (Correction):**
"Sweetheart, this rice is too salty and dry unlike the one you made yesterday. I think we should reduce the salt next time for our health."

Husband A criticized while Husband B corrected his wife in love. **STOP CRITICIZING YOUR WIFE**

## 4. PRAISE HER FOR WHAT IS RIGHT
