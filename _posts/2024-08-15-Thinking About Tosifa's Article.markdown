# 13 WAYS TO CORRECT YOUR WIFE WITHOUT HURTING HER FEELINGS

In any relationship, communication is key. Here are 13 ways to approach correction in your marriage with love and respect.

## 1. LOWER YOUR VOICE

{: .box-error}
Don't shout at her, she is not your child. You can correct, yes, but why shouting?

**Your Response:**
[You are not going to Read.If you do, you won't React/Respond with a healthy mindest.]

## 2. DO IT IN LOVE

{: .box-error}
Correction should be done in love. If done in any other way, it turns to criticism and condemnation.

**Your Response:**
[You are not going to Read.If you do, you won't React/Respond with a healthy mindest.]

## 3. DON'T CRITICIZE

{: .box-error}
Stop criticizing her, rather correct in love. Most will say it's constructive criticism. But truly, It means disapproval by pointing out errors and mistakes.
Correction is the act of offering better options to mistakes.
Correction and criticism are never the same.

### Example:

**Husband A (Criticism):**
"What manner of food is this? Is this popcorn or fried rice? How I wish I married a more sensible wife with better home training, who can cook better."

**Husband B (Correction):**
"Sweetheart, this rice is too salty and dry unlike the one you made yesterday. I think we should reduce the salt next time for our health."

Husband A criticized while Husband B corrected his wife in love. **STOP CRITICIZING YOUR WIFE**

**Your Response:**
[You are not going to Read.If you do, you won't React/Respond with a healthy mindest.]

## 4. PRAISE HER FOR WHAT IS RIGHT

{: .box-error}
It will be wrong to correct when it's not well done, when you don't praise when it's well done. Form the habit of praising and appreciating your wife for good deeds.
